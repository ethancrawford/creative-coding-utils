# Ethan's creative-coding utils

**A small collection of utility files shared between some of my creative coding projects.**

I occasionally dabble with [p5js](https://p5js.org) and [three.js](https://threejs.org), and sometimes find myself needing to share various utility files between projects while using one of those tools.

This package provides those shared utility files. **There is currently only one utility, a module for p5js called `Clock`.**
